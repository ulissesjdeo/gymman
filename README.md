# WorkoutManager

Track and see nice statistics about your gym workout.

## Idea

Sometimes, when extremely focused in progressing load (weight, rest time, intensity or similiar) at workout sessions, people bring notebooks to the gym and write everything, doing this works perfectly but it's not practical and precise.

So I'm creating this app to substitute the gym's notebook, it will let you do exactly the same thing but without bringing a pen and a notebook (just your smartphone that probably you already use at your workout), and the more special, it will have an interface to see complex statistics about everything.
